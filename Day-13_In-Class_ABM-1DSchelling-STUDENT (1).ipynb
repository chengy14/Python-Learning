    "Segregation by race, social class and other factors is a long-standing and pernicious problem in the United States.  Segregation is a complicated problem, whose causes have been historically driven by racial animosity.  Racial segregation has a long and dark history, and was once pervasively enforced by the government.  Although much effort has been extended to desegregate schools, churches and neighborhoods, segregation along racial and economic lines continues to persist in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although incomplete, simple models can be used to help understand this phenomenon and how it can be reversed. As you saw in the pre-class assignment, **Nicky Case** developed a game-based model that explores simple rules in a 2D world to see how small-scale individual preferences can have larger effects on society called the \"[Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, an economist [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) published a simpler, 1D model in what would become a landmark paper called \"[Dynamic Models of Segregation](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf).\" In it, Schelling tried to explore how, in a simple toy system, individuals segregate themselves even if they have an expressed preference for having neighbors different from themselves. In other words: Schelling explored how small individual preferences can lead to larger-scale social segregation, where 'like' people clump together."

    "# Reminder, the rules of the Schelling model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Schelling sets up the rules for a 1-dimensional simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whether a resident wants to move\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everybody wants at least half their neighbors to be like themselves \n",
    "- Everyone defines 'their neighborhood' to include the four nearest neighbors on either side of them\n",
    "- A star wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to also be stars\n",
    "- A zero wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to also be zeros\n",
    "- For those near the end of the line the rule is that, of the four neighbors on the side toward the center plus the one, two or three outboard neighbors, half must be like oneself (Hint: this rule gets at the idea of who the neighbors are for people near the end of the line, e.g. if you're 3 people from the end, you only have 2 neighbors on the outside of where you're at.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a resident moves\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dissatisfied resident moves to the nearest point that meets their minimum demand---the nearest point at which half of their neighbors will be like themselves when they arrive there\n",
    "- 'Nearest' means the point reached by passing the smallest number of neighbors on the way\n",
    "- A resident moves by shoving themselves between any two other residents. (It's a bit like cutting in a line/queue: if you want to cut in, you just kind of insert yourself between two people already in line and the rest of the line adjusts around you)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The order of moves\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arbitrarily let the discontented members (those who have fewer than four neighbors like themselves) move in turn, counting from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who gets to move, and when\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only discontented members are eligible to move\n",
    "- When people become happy, they don't want to move anymore. If an originally discontented member (when the game started) ends up content when their turn comes up, they stay put. (e.g. They used to be unhappy, someone moved, and now they're content.)\n",
    "- Anyone who *becomes* discontent gets a turn *after* the originally unhappy people get to move. (This rule is a little tricky, so make sure you feel like you comfortably understand it.)\n",
    "- The definition of a neighborhood is the four nearest neighbors on either side **at the moment one decides to move or stay**; if someone moves in between a resident and their next-door neighbor, they push the fourth neighbor out of the neighborhood. (If a line is 100 people long, the theater only fits 100 people, and you cut somewhere in line, then whoever was last in line isn't getting into the theater. Womp womp. Note that doesn't mean that the overall population changes, but a individual's neighborhood could change as other individuals move.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What residents know about other residents\n",
    "\n",
    "- The residents don't think ahead; if it's their turn to move, they base their decision only on the state of their neighborhood as they see it, on that turn. They don't plan ahead, and they don't try to figure out what the other neighbors *might* do. \n"

    "The following code puts all of the above pieces together to run a simulation and plot the result as the simulation evolves. Try changing the initial size of the board, the size of the neighborhood that people care about, and the tolerance for living next to different versus the same people. Watch out for runaway simulation. **For some parts of parameter space the model either takes a long time to converge to a steady state solution, or may never converge. The code makes sure to stop the code eventually, even if there are still too many \"unhappy\" peoiple.** In particular, if you try making the neighborhood too small, you tend to run into simulations that never converage because people keep trying to move around. You may also run into issues for values of \"tolerance\" that are greater than 0.8.\n",
