    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Segregation by race, social class and other factors is a long-standing and pernicious problem in the United States.  Segregation is a complicated problem, whose causes have been historically driven by racial animosity.  Racial segregation has a long and dark history, and was once pervasively enforced by the government.  Although much effort has been extended to desegregate schools, churches and neighborhoods, segregation along racial and economic lines continues to persist in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although incomplete, simple models can be used to help understand this phenomenon and how it can be reversed. **Nicky Case** developed a game-based model that explores simple rules in a 2D world to see how small-scale individual preferences can have larger effects on society called the \"[Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, an economist [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) published a simpler, 1D model in what would become a landmark paper called \"[Dynamic Models of Segregation](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf).\" In it, Schelling tried to explore how, in a simple toy system, individuals segregate themselves even if they have an expressed preference for having neighbors different from themselves. In other words: Schelling explored how small individual preferences can lead to larger-scale social segregation, where 'like' people clump together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The sensitivity around race and historical artifacts in the present day\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying this model and the history involved means also accepting the baggage that surrounds them. These models offer us great insight into social systems, but they also have a history and implications that touch on tense social issues. So, as a class, let's:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be aware that we come from many different backgrounds\n",
    "- Know that segregation can take many forms, not all of which are strictly based on race\n",
    "- Recognize that the model's function is to try to mimic a phenomenon, not to dictate how society is or should be\n",
    "\n",
    "# Schelling's 1-dimensional toy system\n",
    "\n",
    "His first toy system looked like this: a one-dimensional set of characters to stand in for individuals who differed on some property:\n",
    "\n",
    "+++OOO+++O+O++O+O+OOO+O++OOO++OOOO+++++O+O++OO+O+OO+++\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, that everybody wants at least half of their neighbors to share this property, and that everyone defines their 'neighborhood' to include the four nearest neighbors on either side. In other words, **a \"+\" wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to be \"+\"s; and a \"O\" wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to be \"O\"s**. Including themselves, this means that they want a bare majority, five out of the nine. (For those near the end of the line the rule is that, of the four neighbors on the side toward the center plus the one, two or three outboard neighbors, half must be like oneself)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your Turn - Calculate an individual's preference assuming a neighborhood size of +/- 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another line, and put dots over the characters that want to move. We'll take two individual characters (two zeroes) as examples. The first zero *doesn't* want to move, because its neighborhood has a simple majority of zeroes like itself. But what about the zero that lives next door? \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how Schelling sets up the rules for a 1-dimensional simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whether a resident wants to move\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everybody wants at least half their neighbors to be like themselves \n",
    "- Everyone defines their 'neighborhood' to include the four nearest neighbors on either side\n",
    "- A plus wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to be plus\n",
    "- A zero wants at least four of their eight nearest neighbors to be zeros\n",
    "- For those near the end of the line the rule is that, of the four neighbors on the side toward the center plus the one, two or three outboard neighbors, half must be like oneself\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a resident moves\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dissatisfied resident moves to the nearest point that meets their minimum demand---the nearest point at which half of their neighbors will be like themselves when they arrive\n",
    "- 'Nearest' means the point reached by passing the smallest number of neighbors on the way\n",
    "- A resident moves by shoving themselves between any two other residents. (It's a bit like cutting in a line/queue: if you want to cut in, you just kind of insert yourself between two people already in line and the rest of the line adjusts around you)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The order of moves\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arbitrarily let the discontented members (those who have fewer than four neighbors like themselves) move in turn, counting from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who gets to move, and when\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only discontented members are eligible to move\n",
    "- When people become happy, they don't want to move anymore. If an originally discontented member (when the game started) ends up content when their turn comes up, they stay put. (e.g. They used to be unhappy, someone moved, and now they're content.)\n",
    "- Anyone who *becomes* discontent gets a turn *after* the originally unhappy people get to move. (This rule is a little tricky, so make sure you feel like you comfortably understand it.)\n",
    "- The definition of a neighborhood is the four nearest neighbors on either side **at the moment one decides to move or stay**; if someone moves in between a resident and their next-door neighbor, they push the fourth neighbor out of the neighborhood. (If a line is 100 people long, the theater only fits 100 people, and you cut somewhere in line, then whoever was last in line isn't getting into the theater. Womp womp. Note that doesn't mean that the overall population changes, but a individual's neighborhood could change as other individuals move.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What residents know about other residents\n",
    "\n",
    "- The residents don't think ahead; if it's their turn to move, they base their decision only on the state of their neighborhood as they see it, on that turn. They don't plan ahead, and they don't try to figure out what the other neighbors *might* do. \n",
